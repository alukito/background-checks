# Background Check application

This project showcases the implementation of a background checks application with Temporal.
The application is written in the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/), and uses the 
Temporal [Go SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go).
See the list of available Temporal SDKs [here](https://docs.temporal.io/). 

The use case for this application is inspired by the blog post 
["How Temporal simplified Checkr workflows"](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/how-temporal-simplified-checkr-workflows/)
