Hello, 

Your potential employer has requested that we conduct a background check on their behalf.

The following information is needed to complete your check:
- Full Name (as it appears on your government ID)
- Social Security Number
- Current Employer

Please give permission for us proceed with the check by running this command and adding your details:

./run-cli bgc-candidate accept --token {{.Token}} --fullname 'your name here' --ssn '111-11-1111' --employer 'Your current employer'

If you would rather we did not run the check you can decline by running this command:

./run-cli bgc-candidate decline --token {{.Token}}

Thanks,

Background Check System
